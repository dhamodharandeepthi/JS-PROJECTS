## Features

- Users can switch the background color of the page by clicking on one of the color options.
- The available colors are Orange, Green, Blue, and Pink.
- The text color automatically changes to white to ensure readability against the selected background color.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the webpage, including the layout, fonts, and color options.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the color switching functionality.

## How It Works

1. The HTML file defines a list of color options inside an unordered list (`<ul>`).
2. Each list item (`<li>`) represents a color, and when clicked, it triggers a JavaScript function.
3. The JavaScript functions change the `background-color` and `color` properties of the `<body>` element to the selected color.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Click on any of the color options to change the background color of the page.

## Customization

- You can easily add more colors by adding new list items (`<li>`) in the `index.html` file and defining corresponding color values in the `script.js` file.
- The styles can be adjusted in the `style.css` file to change the appearance of the color options or the layout.
