## Formula Used

The EMI is calculated using the formula:

\[
EMI = \frac{P \times r \times (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

Where:

- \( P \) is the principal loan amount.
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and converted to a decimal).
- \( n \) is the loan tenure in months.

## Example

For a loan amount of â‚¹1,00,000 at an annual interest rate of 10% for a tenure of 5 years, the EMI would be calculated as follows:

- **Loan Amount**: â‚¹1,00,000
- **Interest Rate**: 10% p.a
- **Tenure**: 5 years

Click "Calculate" to get the EMI.
